        How To Practise Problems
        </p>
      </h2>
      <div class="container" id="step1">
        <p>
          <h4><u>Practise all</u></h4>
          <br>
        </p>
        Whenever you would get to know a chapter of a physics then you will have to do practise a lot. When you will understand a chapter there will be a lot question on the basis of that chapter. You will have to take a notebook then try to solve all the problems of that chapter.
        When you will practise all the problems then you will achieve a confidence of that chapter. You have to remember that <b>"Practise makes a man perfet"</b>. As much as you will practise the problems the chapter will become a piece of cake for you. 
      </div>
      <div class="container" id="step2">
        <p>
          <h4><u>Mark it</u></h4>
          <br>
        </p>
        Human is not computer. So on the first attempt you will not get the whole idea about any chapter even sometime you will not get any idea about that chapter in the first attempt.<br>
        What you had understood and what you hadn't you would get that by practise. When you will start to solve the problems of any chapter there will be a lot of questions that you can't solve at that time. You have to mark that. You will understand what you need to read again.
      </div>
      <div class="container" id="step3">
        <p>
          <h4><u>Double check</u></h4>
          <br>
        </p>
        When the practise session will be end you have to do it then.<br>
        Sometimes you can't solve a problem on the first attempt you have to mark that down. After finishing the practise you need to recheck the marked one again. If you can solve that problem then it would be very good. But if you can't then that is the time you need your teacher or someone who can solve that problem.
