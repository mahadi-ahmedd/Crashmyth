        STEPS TO LEARN BASIC PHYSICS

          <h6>
            Whenever we read a theory at first we have to know the basic concept of that theory. We have to know what was the purpose of that theory, who invented that, 
  how the theory works. For example: E=mc². We all know that this theory had invented Albert Einstein. The meaning of this theory is energy(E) and mass(m) (matter) are interchangeable; they are different forms of the same thing. Now after knowing that once you just have to know remember the theory. Whenever
  you will recall the theory the summary will automatically hit on your mind. You will just have to remember this :<br>
  E = energy<br>
  m = matter<br>
  c = speed of light<br>
  E = mc²<br>

          <h4><u>Step 2: Remember the whole concept only by the theory.</u></h4>
          <br>
        </p>
        <p>
          <h6>
            When you know a lot of theories, you have to keep the summary of that concept always in your memory by that theories. Here are some theories :<br>
  E=mc²<br>
  F=ma<br>
  PV=nRT  <br> 
  The first one's meaning is energy(E) and mass(m) (matter) are interchangeable; they are different forms of the same thing.<br><br>
  
  The second one's meaning is the force (F) acting on an object is equal to the mass (m) of an object times its acceleration (a).<br><br>
  
  The third one's meaning is The pressure(P) of a gas times its volume(V) equals <u>the number of moles</u>(n) of the gas times a constant (R) times the temperature(T) of the gas.

          <h4><u>Step 3: Find out the elements from the question then answer it</u></h4>
          <br>
        </p>
        <p>
          <h6>
            Whenever you try to answer a question you should follow this step.
  Here is a question:<br><br><br>
  <b>If the mass is 0.1 kg, the pressure of that matter is 5 atm and the temperature of that atmosphere is 15°C what is the energy of that matter ?</h6></b><br>
  <b>Note:</b>Now from this question you have to find out what is given and what is wanted. At first when we will start to read the question we will read mass that means "m", then we will get pressure that means "p" and lastly we will get temperature that means "T". Now we have all the elements which is given. Now we have to find out what is wanted. The wanted element is energy that means "E".<br>
  Now we have to recall the theories around this wanted element.<br>
  In this case we need E=mc².<br>
  So the solution is:<br>
  E=mc²<br>
  E=0.1*3×10^8<br>
  E=3*10^7<br>
