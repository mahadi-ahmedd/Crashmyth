          The Idea Behind Crashmyth
          </h2>
          </u>
            <p>
              When students introduced with physics for the first time it is always a horrible experience for them. Before physics students used to do mathematics where they just learn a basic theory and then apply it to problems and Then solve it. But in the case of physics it is different. In the case of physics, they not only have to learn the basic theory but also have to learn the source, the whole concept, the modern theory , the classical theory, the inventor, how he/she invented that and so on. At this moment a student completely lose his/her motivation to learn that subject. For that reason crashmyth is here to reduce the burden of learning physics.

              Too often, physics students are beset by feelings of failure and isolation rather than experiencing the creative joys of discovery that physics has to offer. This dissertation research was founded on the desire of a teacher to make physics class exciting and motivating to his students. This work explores how various aspects of learning environments interact with student motivation. This work uses qualitative and quantitative methods to explore how students are motivated to engage in physics and how they feel about themselves while engaging in physics. The collection of four studies in this dissertation culminates in a sociocultural perspective on motivation and identity. This perspective uses two extremes of how students experience physics as a lens for understanding motivation: fear and self-preservation versus integrity and self-expression. Rather than viewing motivation as a property of the student, or viewing students as inherently interested or disinterested in physics, the theoretical perspective on motivation and identity helps examine features of the learning environments that determine how students experience themselves through physics class. This perspective highlights the importance of feeling a sense of belonging in the context of physics and the power that teachers have in shaping student motivations through the construction of their classroom learning environments. Findings demonstrate how different ways that students experience themselves in physics class impact their performance and interest in physics. This dissertation concludes with a set of design principles that can foster integration and integrity among students in physics learning environments

              Today’s physics is a subject expressed through advanced mathematical equations.  For the most part, the reality behind these equations is ignored.  Instead, physics falls into the category of instrumentalism, whereby the reality is of secondary importance to the predictability of these equations.  Unquestionably, present equations of quantum mechanics and quantum field theory have proven themselves invaluable in making accurate predictions.  But this comes at a price of missing out on a complete understanding of what is going on behind the curtain of these equations. The question becomes can we understand what’s behind the curtain? Crashmyth is here to simplify it. Though it will not teach you the concepts of physics but it will help you to know that how to understand a concept of physics.

              When students learn physics and it's concepts then there comes a time to apply it. But there is a slight difference between physics. When there is moment of solving a problem of physics, student have to think about logic. In the question there is only one element is needed but for that element student have to find out some other elemnts too to solve that by the clues given in question. Severel times students get anxious to find that out. Because they can't find out the right path to solve that.<br>
              Crashmyth is here to show that path. Crashmyth will show the students a simple way to solve any problem. Sometimes Problem includes several equations. At that moment a student get confuse from where to start.<br> Crashmyth will show the students that how to observe a problem. Then how to use the clues given in the question and then lastly how to solve the problem.
